## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate the security community's efforts in helping keep OpenCall safe. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure practices.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email us at **security@opencall.io** with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)
3. Use our PGP key for sensitive communications (see below)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Timeline**: 30-90 days depending on severity
- **Credit**: Security researchers are credited (unless anonymity requested)

### PGP Key

For encrypted communications:
```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP key would be inserted here]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

## 🏗️ Security Architecture

### Encryption

- **End-to-End**: MLS Protocol with forward secrecy
- **Transport**: TLS 1.3 minimum, DTLS for WebRTC
- **At Rest**: AES-256-GCM for stored data
- **Key Management**: Automatic rotation, secure derivation

### Authentication

- **Zero-Knowledge**: SRP-6a protocol
- **Sessions**: JWT with secure HttpOnly cookies
- **MFA**: TOTP support (enterprise)
- **SSO**: SAML 2.0 compliant

### Infrastructure

- **Network**: Firewall rules, DDoS protection
- **Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection
- **Updates**: Automated security patches
- **Auditing**: Comprehensive audit logs

## 🔍 Security Features

### Built-in Protections

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   ```
   default-src 'self';
   script-src 'self' 'nonce-{random}';
   style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
   img-src 'self' data: blob: https:;
   connect-src 'self' wss: https://ipfs.io;
   ```

2. **Request Validation**
   - Input sanitization
   - Rate limiting
   - Size limits
   - CSRF protection

3. **Secure Headers**
   - Strict-Transport-Security
   - X-Content-Type-Options
   - X-Frame-Options
   - Referrer-Policy

### Security Controls

- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions
- **Data Isolation**: Tenant separation
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable logs
- **Compliance**: GDPR, HIPAA ready

## 🧪 Security Testing

### Automated Testing

- **SAST**: Static code analysis on every commit
- **DAST**: Dynamic testing in staging
- **Dependencies**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Containers**: Image scanning before deployment

### Manual Testing

- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly by third parties
- **Code Review**: Security-focused reviews
- **Threat Modeling**: Regular assessments
- **Red Team**: Annual exercises

## 📋 Security Checklist

For contributors, ensure:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation on all user data
- [ ] Proper error handling (no stack traces)
- [ ] Secure random number generation
- [ ] No use of deprecated crypto
- [ ] HTTPS/WSS only connections
- [ ] Principle of least privilege
- [ ] Security headers configured

## 🚫 Known Limitations

### By Design

1. **No Key Recovery**: Lost keys cannot be recovered
2. **No Backdoors**: E2E encryption has no bypass
3. **No Tracking**: We cannot track users or meetings

### Temporary Limitations

1. **Post-Quantum**: Not yet quantum-resistant (planned)
2. **HSM Support**: Software keys only (enterprise planned)
